Beer-Ontology
Purpose
The Beer-Ontology project aims to create a structured and reusable ontology to represent the domain of beers, their styles, breweries, characteristics, and related concepts such as tasting notes, food pairings, and regions. This ontology can serve as a foundation for applications in beer recommendation systems, educational tools, and brewery management systems.
